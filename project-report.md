## 1. Executive Summary

### Project Overview

The Hospital eTicketing web app is a revolutionary project designed to address the inefficiencies and challenges associated with acquiring a doctor's appointment in Bangladesh. The project leverages Python Flask to create a user-friendly, web based platform that allows patients to obtain e-tickets for patient to visit doctor. This system will streamline the process of ticket collection and reduce the burden of long queues and valuable times at hospitals.

### Problem Statement

In Bangladesh, the conventional system of acquiring a doctor's appointment involves physically queuing up at the hospital, resulting in long waiting times and inconvenience for patients. This project aims to solve this issue by providing an online eTicketing system, eliminating the need for patients to be physically present at the hospital to obtain a ticket.

### Project Objectives

- Develop a user-friendly web application for eTicketing in hospitals.

- Collect patient personal information, disease details, and allow hospital selection.

- Streamline the process, reducing waiting times and improving the overall healthcare experience.

### Scope of the Project

The project's scope encompasses the development of the Hospital eTicketing web app, including data submission, and ticket collection. The project will initially focus on hospitals within Bangladesh.

### Project Team

- **Team Leader, Software Architect & Full Stack Developer:** Muhammad Sultan Al Mahfuz

- **Project Proposer:** Md. Nurnobi

- **UI/UX Designer:** Amrito Kumar Pramanik

- **Frontend Developer:** Uzzal Bhowmik

## 4. Problem Statement

### Overview of the Problem

The existing healthcare system in Bangladesh requires patients to be physically present at hospitals to collect tickets, leading to long queues and inconvenience. This problem results in inefficiencies and negatively impacts the patient experience.

### Current System

- Patients must physically visit hospitals to collect tickets.
- Long queues and waiting times are common.
- Inefficient and time-consuming.

### Limitations

The current system has several limitations, including:

- Limited accessibility, particularly for those with mobility issues.

- Must be need 365/7/24 technical support.

- Impacts patient satisfaction and healthcare efficiency.

---

## 5. Solution Approach

### System Design

The web app will have a user-friendly interface with sections for personal information, disease details, and hospital selection. Data will be securely stored in a database, and e-tickets will be generated and confirmed.

### Project Architecture

The system will follow a client-server architecture, with a secure connection for data transfer and storage. The server will run the Flask application, and a suitable database will be employed.

### Functional Requirements

- Form submission for personal and disease information.
- Hospital selection based on location.
- E-ticket generation and confirmation.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Data encryption and user authentication.
- **Performance:** Fast response times and scalability.
- **Usability:** Intuitive and user-friendly design.

## 6. User Requirements

### Personal Information

Users will be required to provide:

- Name
- Age
- Phone Number
- Email

### Disease Information

Users can either:

- Select a disease from a pre-defined list.
